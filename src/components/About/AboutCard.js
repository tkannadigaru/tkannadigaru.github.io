            The history of Trollh√§ttan Kannadigara sangha is very short,
            we were just a few families who were getting together for the 
            occational ugadi, holi and deepavali festivals.
            <br />
            <br />

            This transitioned into upwards of 20 families with organized events
            for Ugadi and Deepawali.
            <br />
            <br />

            And in March 2023, we finally registered with Skattaverket 
            to have our official kannada sangha
